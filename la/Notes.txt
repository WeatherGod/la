	e.g.  vaccuum, remove a row 
	indxb = isfinite(x).any(1).any(1) # is 1d boolean for not all nan, i.e. keep if true
	idx = np.nonzero(idx)  # integer index
	newx = x[idxb]
	newlabel = label.deepcopy()
	newlabel[axis] = label[idx]
	
	
convert nd (n>2) to 2d 
	rollaxis for cross-section/columns (axis 2) to front or end
	reshape 
	loop labels to create combined labels of rows
	reverse/inverse operation
	useful also for using methods and functions that work only for 2d
	
sector/group functions axis argument ?

integer overflow possible problems - promote to float
    * larry.sum uses np.nansum
      >>> np.nansum([1,2,3])
	  6
	* other cases - not checked

which dtypes should be allowed for a larry ?
    * float
    * object for sector names
    * integers
    * strings ?

ranking functions
    * more flexibility axis, 3d ? 
    * meaning of 3d lastrank is not clear (maybe better with nd2table)
    * ranking_norm : for 1d the default changes 
      (matrix with 1 row axis=0, is different from 1d array with axis=0)
      newr = ranking_norm(x[0,:])
      oldr = la.afunc.ranking_norm(x[0,:], axis=1)
