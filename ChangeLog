    * core/deflarry.py: Made it possible to subclass larry without having it
      revert back to a regular larry when certain methods are called. I did
      that by changing larry(x, label) to type(self)(x, label) in many places.

    * afunc.py(nanmedian): There were two nanmedian functions: one that used
      numpy matrices and one taken from scipy that uses numpy arrays. I
      deleted the matrx version.

    * svn_export.py(svn_export): Fixed typo in path.

    * svn_export.py: Added a module that exports the la package from svn and
      tar and bz2 it.

    * __init__.py: Remove deflarry from namespace created when you import la.

    * initial svn import of la package.
