Meet larry, he's a labeled array.

A two-dimensional larry, for example, contains a 2d NumPy array with labels
on each row and column. A larry can have any dimension.

Alignment by label is automatic when you add (or subtract, multiply, divide)
two larrys.
    
larry has built-in methods such as movingsum, ranking, merge, shuffle,
zscore, demean, lag as well as typical Numpy methods like sum, max, std,
sign, clip. NaNs are treated as missing data.
 
You can archive larrys in HDF5 format using save and load or using a
dictionary-like interface.
       
For the most part larry acts like a Numpy array. And, whenever you want,
you have direct access to the Numpy array that holds your data.
    
larry adds the convenience of labels, provides many built-in methods, and
let's you use many of your existing NumPy array functions.
